## Hands-on A Overview

---

### Local Configuration
Create a folder
Configure it to be managed by git

### GitHub Configuration
  * Create a "folder" like thing on GitHub
  * It is called repository

### Linking Local & GitHub
  * Configure the two to be linked
  * Create a file on the local side and run git commands, the file will appear on GitHub.com

### Create a Local Git Repository
  * With your terminal, go to Documents and create a directory named `kintone_dojo`
    * `pwd ~/Documents/kintone_dojo`
  * In this folder, using the `git init` command, initialize a repository
  * Repository is often shortened to Repo

### Add a README.md file to the Local Repo
  * Create a README.md file
    * README file is used to describe a software/ git repo's purpose and usage.
  * Open the current kintone_dojo directory with VS Code
  * Add a description of your repository in the markdown file

### Check Git's Status
  * git status
  * command that shows the working directory's & staging area's state
  * **Changes to be committed**:
    * You can see which changes have & have not been staged
  * **Untracked files**:
    * You can see which files are not being tracked by git
  * See that the README.md needs to be tracked by git

### Saving #1 * Add a File to Git's Staging Area
  * git add [file/folder]
  * command to add the [file/folder] to the staging area
  * Now the README.md is now in staging area
  * We prepped the file! Now it is GREEN!
  * Next, we need to commit the file to have git track the changes

### Saving #2 * Add a File to Git Repo
  * git commit -m "message"
  * command to add the file/folder to the repository
  * Now the README.md is now in the repository
  * specifically the master branch
  * git commit commands makes git fully track the file
  * Similar to the game check-point
  * -m is the adding message option
  * It is important to include the purpose of the changes as commit's message for teamwork + history

### Create a GitHub Repository
  * Create a Repository
    * <https://github.com/new>
  * Name your repository kintone_dojo
  * Do not initialize repository with README!

### Local Git :arrow_forward: GitHub
  * Push the existing repository!
    * Get the URL by clicking on `Clone or download` button & copying the HTTPS link
  * `git remote add origin <link>`
    * connects the git managed local repository with GitHub's remote
  * `git remote`
  * command to manage the remote repos

### Hands-On A is Completed
  * Install & Configure git on PC
  * Create & Configure GitHub
  * Create & push a local repository

## Hands-On A's Concepts

---

### Saving Changes with Git
  * There are 2 commands to transfer the items between the "locations"
  * There are 3 "locations" where files, folders, and changes are stored

#### working directory
  * the current local directory that you are working on.
  * all changes first takes place here

#### git add
  * command that promotes a change from working directory to staging area

#### staging area
  * the buffer between the working directory & the repository
  * used to be called the 'index'
  * the promoted changes are bundled together, waiting for the next commit

#### Why have Staging Area?
  * To stage a file = prepare the file for a commit

##### Staging Area Metaphor
  * Imagine you are making music
    * You write various songs with varying messages. (Everything from a hateful to a loving songs)
    * Now do you want to upload all your music randomly?
    * No, you want to upload the songs bundled as albums with a theme.
  * To make a romantic album:
    * you `git add` only your love songs
    * As you are still looking for and selecting songs to add to the album, the selected songs are stored in the `Staging Area`
    * Once you have all the songs you want in the album stored in the `Staging Area`, time to commit!
    * you `git commit -m` with the album title, "Love Song"

#### git commit
  * command to record changes to the repository
  * used once all the files with the changes you want to be saved are in staging area
  * Game Check-In
  * it is like when you defeated the boss & want to save your progress in the game
  * comments per commit  provides a natural documentation

#### repository
  * git repository is the actual  ".git" folder inside a project
  * the folder tracks all the changes made in the project
  * i.e. the historian
  * remote repository (GitHub)
  * the repository on GitHub's server, allowing the code to be viewed by others

### Working with Remote Repos
  * `git remote add origin <link>`
  * git creates an alias of the remote repository when you clone a remote repository to your local machine
  * i.e. nickname is assigned per remote repository's URL
  * Most common alias is called "origin."
  * Thus, both following commands does the same thing:
    * git push -u <https://github.com/user/repo.git> master
    * git remote add ALIAS <https://github.com/ahandsel/repo.git>
    * git push -u ALIAS master

#### git remote command
  * manages the connection between your local & remote repositories

#### git remote --verbose
  * lists out the URLs that Git has stored & alias (nickname) that can be used when reading & writing to that remote repo

### git push [remote] [branch]
  * command to upload local repo content to a remote repo
  * i.e. export the commits from your local -> remote repo
  * counterpart to git fetch (import commits to local repo)

Note: Pushing can potentially overwrite changes!

  * git push command works only for remote repo that has not been modified since your last push or clone
    * i.e. No one else changed the remote repo after you
    * if you & another user cloned at the same time and they push upstream before you, your push will rightly be rejected
    * you will need to fetch their work and include it in your push first

### Hands-on A Review
  * Saving with Git
  * git remote
    * Command to manage the connection between the local & remote repos
  * git push
    * Command to upload local repo content to a remote repo

### Hands-on A Quiz Time
  * Q1: How is Git & GitHub related?
    * Hint: "hub" means the center of an activity or network.
  * Q2: Which comes first, `git add` or `git commit`?
    * Hint: "commit" means to pledge yourself to a certain action (like marriage).
  * Q3: What does `git push` command do?
    * Hint: "git push" command does the opposite of "git fetch" command.

## Hands-on B - Make & Merge Branches

---


### Create a New Branch
  * By default, a repository has a **master** branch
  * Let's create a new branch named **develop**
  * `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
    * command to create a new branch & switch to it
  * `git branch`
    * command to view a list of branches
    * current branch has the asterisk (*)

```sh
$ git checkout -b develop
Switched to a new branch 'develop'

$ git branch
* develop
  master
```

### Changing develop Branch
  * While being in the **develop** branch, create a file.
  * Run `git add` and `git commit` to save it to the local repo.
  * Run `git status` to confirm the changes.
  * Run `git push` to push the changes to GitHub repo

```sh
$ touch develop_file.md
$ git add develop_file.md
$ git commit -m "develop only"
[develop f946eb0] File only in develop branch
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 develop_file.md
$ git status
On branch develop
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ git push -u origin develop
```


---

### Confirming the Change on GitHub
  * Only the develop branch included the new file
  * Add another file in develop branch
  * Then view the Network graph
    * `https://github.com/USER/REPO/network`

### Create & Merge Pull Request
  * **Pull Requests** shows others your changes without actual modifying
    * useful for code review
  * On GitHub, create the **pull request** to merge **develop** -> **master** branch
  * Confirm the changes and **Merge** Pull request
  * This results in **master** branch having the two new files!

### GitHub repo -> Update Local repo
  * Currently, your GitHub repo is ahead of the local copy
    * Use `git pull` command to address this
  * `git pull origin master`
    * pull the latest repo version from GitHub to the local repo
  * Following commands
    * `git checkout master`
    * `git pull origin master`
    * `git branch -d develop`
    * `git branch`
  * Outcome:

  ```sh
  $ git checkout master
  Switched to branch 'master'
  Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 4 commits & can be fast-forwarded
    (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

  $ git pull origin master
  remote: Enumerating objects: 1, done.
  remote: Counting objects: 100% (1/1), done.
  remote: Total 1 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
  Unpacking objects: 100% (1/1), 631 bytes | 210.00 KiB/s, done.
  From https://github.com/ahandsel/kintone_dojo
  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
    5f9f89b..1438ca5  master     -> origin/master
  Updating d775d42..1438ca5
  Fast-forward
  2nd_file.md     | 0
  develop_file.md | 0
  2 files changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
  create mode 100644 2nd_file.md
  create mode 100644 develop_file.md

  $ git branch -d develop
  Deleted branch develop (was c6e6c83).

  $ git branch
  * master
  ```

## What are branches? | Overview of Hands-on B

### Git Branches

#### What are branches?
  * movable pointer to a `git commit`
  * mechanism that manages multiple timelines, allowing for changes without impacting the main line
  * `git checkout`
    * command to switch branches
  * `git branch -d <branch-name>`
    * command to delete branches

#### Why use branches?
  * allows for a separation between stable, in-development, and experimental changes
  * Example: This GitHub Slides
    * Each Hands-on and concept section can be a branch.
    * Each can be developed in parallel.

### Branches - Website
  * master branch contains the 'live' code that runs the website.
  * changes in master impacts users
  * Two coders want to modify the website at the same time.
    * Make 3x branches:
    * master    -> live code
    * feature_A -> for coder A to modify
    * feature_B -> for coder B to modify
  * Once the code developments are done, merge the branches.

### Git Push vs Pull - Teamwork
#### `git push`
  * the 'upload' command
  * "Push" is forcing the changes to the target repo.
    * `[ your code ] -- pushing --> [target]`
  * A "push request" would be the target repo requesting you to push your changes.
#### `git pull`
  * the 'download' command
  * "Pull" is the target repo grabbing your changes
    * `[ your code] }-- pulling -- [target]`
  * A "pull request" is you requesting the target repository to please grab your changes.

## GitHub Workflow

### #1 - Create a Branch
  * The code for the **live** website is in the **master** branch
  * Any changes to here will effect the users!
  * If you want to create a new page, first create a new **feature** branch.
    * This is where you will do the development for the new page.
  * `git checkout -b develop`, `git branch`

### #2 - Making a Commit
  * In your **feature** branch, you are modifying code.
  * Each time you want to save a change, make a `commit`.
  * This keeps track of changes and provides a transparent history.
  * Commits allow for roll backs and references.


### #3 - Open a Pull Request
  * When you are ready to share your changes to others, open a **Pull Request**.
  * Pull Requests are the start of code review.
  * Make & review comments at the Pull Request tab on GitHub.

### #4 - Test
  * After code review, deploy your code in a testing environment to make sure everything works.
  * Example: Test if the website looks and acts as expected on *Zendesk Preview* mode.

### #5 - Merge to Master
  * Merge your code into the **master** branch.
  * Now your changes are live & visible to the users.
  * Once merged, **Pull Requests** acts as reference points.
  * Example: Pull Request for new logo will become a reference point to indicate the "before" and the "after" of the logo change.
